                I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the
                company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

                "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and
                have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
                found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most
                grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as
                a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

                "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
                professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
                did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
                project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
                could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
                experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
                100% recommend!"
